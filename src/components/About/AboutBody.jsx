                If you don’t take anything else away from this article, take away goal-setting. Having a clearly defined goal will set you up to push through all the other steps, all the hours of writing, and all the obstacles bound to show up.

               Your goal is your why, and the stronger it is the more success you’ll have. Just take a look at Simon Sinek’s TED talk about the power of “why”. It’s 20 minutes of pure gold (seriously, go watch it) about why we need to lead from a place of “why” we’re doing something, not how we’re doing it or what we’re doing.

                    Choose no more than two or three of these objectives for your blog content strategy.

               Any more and your blog will become unfocused and won’t succeed at anything. For example, I have a blog for my freelance work. My primary goal is to generate leads for my services, with secondary goals of educating prospects on what I do and building a brand around my name. Be specific with your goals. Simply saying “get more traffic” isn’t enough. You need to include how much traffic you want and in what timeframe. A better goal would be “Increase sales by 15% in three months”. Very specific. Once you have your why, it’s time to figure out what kind of content you need. In order to do that, you must go through.
