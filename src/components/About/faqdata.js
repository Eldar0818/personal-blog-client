        question: 'HOW CAN A BLOGGER STAND OUT?',
        answer: 'I get bored very quickly- I crave change and creativity. So, before I jump to advise you on how to stand out, you have to be authentic. Sometimes it is so easy to get influenced and inspired by others, but you and I are only one! The best way to stand out is to know yourself and be yourself. It’s that simple. There is no magic strategy to stand out!'

        question: 'WHAT IS SOMETHING YOU WISH MORE PEOPLE KNEW ABOUT BLOGGERS?',
        answer: 'The biggest misconception is that some people think bloggers take pretty photos, share products and influence people to buy. It may seem that way, but I wish people knew that bloggers are regular people who have skills, purpose and value. People who don’t see a blogger have not taken the time to learn about their background. I guess that’s why it is essential to have a detailed about me page and answer questions people ask frequently.
